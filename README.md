Athena download page for Standardized Vocabularies
==================================================

This repo contains the content of the Athena download page, available at http://www.ohdsi.org/web/athena. You don't need to use any of this code if you are interested in getting the data tables of the Standardized Vocabularies. Just visit the website, choose your vocabularies and download the material.

This repo is intended for internal purposes, and for folks who want to set up a mirror download page. You are free to do so, however, you will need to provide your own hardware infrastructure, and you need to either copy the content (by using http://www.ohdsi.org/web/athena) or re-create the content using the Athena system (currently under https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0).

For questions, please use the OHDSI Forum pages at http://forums.ohdsi.org/c/implementers. Will need to register to make posts.

Good luck and have fun.
